## Purpose of this action spec
This document states — **for review before execution** — exactly what Governance & Security Agent
will do for PROJ-102. Per the spec-first / SME-approval rule
(`docs/SPEC-002-spec-first-gate.md`), no action listed below is performed until
this spec is approved at the SME gate. It exists so any action this agent takes
is reviewable in isolation, separate from the master spec.

## Planned action for PROJ-102
